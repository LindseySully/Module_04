Sign of the times\nShadows sway to light up my life\nTrace the answers, tears have never made me\nChange from violent delights\nShadows sway, light up my life\nTrace the answers, tears have never made me change\n\nShallow, this is what I created\nSplayed-out skeletons in the cracks in the pavement\nAnd now can you feel the injection back behind those cloudy eyes?\nIn between every cataract, a projection of my life\n\nHow long have I felt this way? Sign of the times\nShadows sway to light up my life\nTrace the answers, tears have never made me\nChange from violent delights\nShadows sway, light up my life\nTrace the answers, tears have never made me change\nSee Spiritbox LiveGet tickets as low as $26You might also like\nIn slow motion\nThe end is imminent, it's imminent\nWithout your devotion\nI need that skyline\nWithout your horizon\nThe end is imminent, it's imminent (It's imminent, it's imminent)\n\nFade, sign of the times\nShadows sway, light up my life\nTrace the answers\n\nTears have never made me change, sign of the times\nShadows sway, light up my life\nTrace the answers, tears have never made me change\n(How long have I felt this way?)\nTrace the answers, tears have never made me change (Change, change, change)Embed"
